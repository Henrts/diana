# Card

The `Card` component is merely a wrapper for the different Card components.
it is advisable to pass only those components (`CardHeader`, `CardBody`, `CardFooter`) as children, even though
you can still pass whatever you please as seen in the example below.
A valid example for a different component would be for instance a `Divider`.

### Simple card

<Preview>
  <Story name="Card">
    <CardStory />
  </Story>
</Preview>

# CardHeader

The `CardHeader` can contain both the `Card`'s title and subtitle.
It also supports having either a label or an icon on the top right corner.

<Preview>
  <Story
    name="CardHeader"
    args={{
      icon: "",
      label: "",
      title: "Card Header Title",
      subtitle: "Card Header Subtitle"
    }}
    argTypes={{
      icon: {
        control: {
          type: "select",
          options: [
            "",
            "add",
            "arrow-down",
            "arrow",
            "block",
            "chart",
            "check",
            "checkmark",
            "chevron-down",
            "chevron-left",
            "chevron-right",
            "chevron-up",
            "close"
          ]
        }
      },
      label: {
        control: {
          type: "text"
        }
      },
      title: {
        control: {
          type: "text"
        }
      },
      subtitle: {
        control: {
          type: "text"
        }
      }
    }}
  >
    {args => (
      <div>
        <CardHeaderStory {...args} />
        <CardHeaderSubtitleStory />
        <CardHeaderLabelStory />
        <CardHeaderIconStory />
      </div>
    )}
  </Story>
</Preview>

# CardBody

The `CardBody` serves as the wrapper for the `Card`'s main content wrapper.

<Preview>
  <Story name="CardBody">
    <CardBodyStory />

The `CardFooter` contains mainly actionable elements like buttons or links.
